    "intro_paragraph": "Welcome! I'm Matthew Moser, and I'm thrilled to share my lifelong passion for grappling martial arts and movement with you. With a unique blend of academic rigor in Kinesiology and extensive practical experience across multiple grappling disciplines, I'm dedicated to providing high-quality instruction in Judo, American Folk Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Submission Grappling.",
    "journey_title": "My Journey & Expertise:",
    "journey_paragraph_1": "My journey in martial arts began early, culminating in achieving a 3rd Degree Black Belt in Judo. This foundation in Judo's throws and pins laid the groundwork for a deeper exploration into the diverse world of grappling. I have since expanded my expertise into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, focusing on ground control and submissions, and have a strong understanding of Wrestling and No-Gi Submission Grappling techniques that are essential for a well-rounded grappler. My competitive background includes placing 3rd and 5th twice in DOD Europe High School Wrestling, further solidifying my practical experience on the mat. I've also had the privilege of serving as an Assistant Head Judo Instructor at the SFSU Judo Club, where I actively coached and guided students.",
    "journey_paragraph_2": "Beyond the mat, my commitment to understanding human movement runs deep. I hold a B.S. in Kinesiology: Exercise Science, Fitness, and Human Movement Analysis from San Francisco State University, where I delved into the intricacies of applied exercise physiology, applied biomechanics, and physical movement analysis. This academic background isn't just theoretical; it informs how I teach, allowing me to explain techniques with a deeper understanding of body mechanics, injury prevention, and optimal performance.",
